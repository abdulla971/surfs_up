# Surfâ€™s Up
Weather analysis using Python, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask.
## Project Overview
In this project we reviewed weather patterns and trends in Hawaii in order to check to open a surf and ice cream shop. It focused on precipitation, temperature for the months June and December to check if the shop can be sustained year round. To do that the following is performed:
- Accessed meteorological data in an SQLite file;
- Wrote queries to examine temperature data collected in the months of June and December;
- Calculated summary statistics (such as the min, max, and average temperatures collected).
